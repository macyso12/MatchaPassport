# MatchaMap Overview

## Problem Space

As matcha grows in popularity, dedicated matcha cafes and drink spots are popping up in cities worldwide. However, finding and comparing these places is still inconvenient — most people rely on generic review platforms like Google Reviews, Yelp, or occasional Reddit threads. These tools aren’t built for matcha lovers, and often fail to highlight the aspects they care about most: ingredient quality, preparation method, flavor profiles, café aesthetic, seating availability, and overall vibe.
MatchaMap is a community-driven app designed specifically for matcha enthusiasts. Users can:

* Discover nearby or trending matcha spots using curated maps and filters.
* Rate & Review cafes with matcha-specific categories (taste, presentation, quality of matcha powder, aesthetic, seating, service).
* Bookmark & Mark Visits to keep track of favorites, wishlists, and spots they’ve tried.
* Share Photos & Notes to give the community more than just star ratings — a visual and experiential guide to each location.

By focusing on matcha-specific criteria and creating a dedicated community, MatchaMap makes it easy for matcha lovers to find their next go-to spot, connect over shared tastes, and support businesses that take their craft seriously.
